# Active-Directory-Home-Lab

<h1>Description of this project until I manage to come around again and implement pictures and steps:</h1>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my active directory administration simulation I wanted to bring this home-lab up to start-up company standards in terms of user count and configuration of servers, access control, and the ability to create more and easily manage new members in the hypothetical situation of on-boarding new employees.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started off by configuring a Remote Access Server (RAS) with features to support NAT/PAT. I then
implemented and maintained Windows DNS and DHCP services and configured windows file servers, with NTFS permissions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once most standard permissions and standards I went ahead and ran a script in Powershell ISE, this
script configured and created over 1,000 users with specific names from a names.txt. Each user was configured with a default
set default password, and a user name of first letter of first name and full last name. As an example; cwhitley.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™ll most likely leave this project as is, unless I want to dive more in depth with DHCP, DNS, and
other networking configurations.
